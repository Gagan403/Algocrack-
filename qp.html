<h3> Keywords and Identifiers</h3>
<h4>Character set</h4>
<p>A character set is a set of alphabets, letters and some special characters that are valid in C language.</p>

<h4>Alphabets</h4>
<p>C accepts both lowercase and uppercase alphabets as variables and functions.</p>
<h4>Digits</h4>
<p>1,2,3,4,5,67,8,9,0</p>
<h4> Special Characters</h4>

<h4> C Keywords</h4>
<p>Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. </p>

<h4> C Identifiers </h4>
<p>Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc. Identifiers must be unique. They are created to give a unique name to an entity to identify it during the execution of the program</p>
<h4>Rules for naming identifiers</h4>
<p>1.A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscores.</p>
<p>2.The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.</p>
<p>3.You cannot use keywords like int, while etc. as identifiers.</p>
<p>4.There is no rule on how long an identifier can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the identifier is longer than 31 characters.</p>
<p>You can choose any name as an identifier if you follow the above rule, however, give meaningful names to identifiers that make sense.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3> C Variables, Constants and Literals</h3>
<h4> Variables</h4>

<p>In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

    To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. </p>
<h4> Rules for naming a Variable</h4>
<p>1. A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.</p>
<p>2. The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.</p>
<p>3. There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.</p><br><br>
<p>C is a strongly typed language. This means that the variable type cannot be changed once it is declared</p><br><br>
<h4>Literals</h4>
<p>Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For example: 1, 2.5, 'c' etc.

    Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.</p>
<h4>1. Integers</h4>
<p>An integer is a numeric literal(associated with numbers) without any fractional or exponential part. There are three types of integer literals in C programming:</p>
<p>1.decimal (base 10)</p>
<p>2.octal (base 8)</p>
<p>3.hexadecimal (base 16)</p><br><br>
<p>In C programming, octal starts with a 0, and hexadecimal starts with a 0x.</p><br><br>
<h4>2.2. Floating-point Literals</h4>
<p>A floating-point literal is a numeric literal that has either a fractional form or an exponent form.</p>
<h4>3. Characters</h4>
<p>A character literal is created by enclosing a single character inside single quotation marks. For example: 'a', 'm', 'F', '2', '}' etc.</p><br><br>
<h4>4. Escape Sequences</h4>
<p>Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters that cannot be typed or has special meaning in C programming. For example: newline(enter), tab, question mark etc.

    In order to use these characters, escape sequences are used.</p><br>
